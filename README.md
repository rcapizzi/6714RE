# 6714RE
Relation Extraction project

This project for COMP6714 Information Retrieval & Web Search involved analysing various segments of text to extract textual relations by analysing grammatical rules. 
Relations are usually represented as triplets of (subject, predicate, object). For example,
("Henry Hansen", DateOfBirth, "April 28,1907")

Goal of this task:
In this project, I was tasked to analyse text segments for DateofBirth and HasParent relations. The task was primarily accomplished by using a refined regular expression statement inside python to analyse the text data.
