Relation Extraction project

This project involved analysing various segments of text to extract textual relations by analysing grammatical rules.
Relations are usually represented as triplets of (subject, predicate, object). For example,
("Henry Hansen", DateOfBirth, "April 28,1907")
("Henry Hansen", PlaceOfBrith, "La Crosse")
("Henry Hansen", PlaceOfBrith, "Wisconsin")
("Henry Hansen", HasParent, "Andrew")
("Henry Hansen", HasParent, "Emma Petersen Hansen")

Goal of this task:
In this project, you will build a relation extractor to extract specific relations from a
given corpus. You need to implement a program in Python 3 that extracts two specific relations from
an input file consisting of sentences and NER results. The two relations are : DateOfBirth,
and HasParent.
